# Frog Programming Language

Welcome to Frog, a whimsical and enlightening journey into the world of
computer science!

Frog isn't just a toy programming language; it's my gateway to master
complex concepts like lexers, AST parsers, and evaluators. Inspired by the
brilliant book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com),
Frog is more than a projectâ€”it's an adventure.

## Why Frog?

In June 2024, I stumbled upon this gem of a book and decided to spend my summer
diving deep into the intricacies of language development. But I didn't stop
there! Frog goes beyond the basics, adding new layers of functionality and
creativity to make the learning process both fun and challenging.
